###How are new peers discovered?###
- New peers must have knowledge of at least 1 peer. This peer will inform the rest.

###Are administrators distinct from peers?###
- The administrator is just the set of all peers as a collective whole. There is no one individual admin.


###How do we handle a peer dropping?###
- Don't worry about it. Assume the servers are stable and will not DC without notifying the other peers first.
